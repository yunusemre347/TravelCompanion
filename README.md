# React Travel Companion app

This app is a travel companion app. It shows restaurants, hotels and attractions around the selected place. Places are marked on a GoogleMap component.

In order to use react-google-map package you need to remove strict mode or downgrade to react 17. Otherwise you need to use  @react-google-maps/api like i did in this project.


Known issues

I still have error about api key being called multiple times. Google didnt force this until recently. So i couldnt find a solution yet and the solutions i tried havent worked. I will fix it later. 

Test writing and performance optimization will come next.
